<h2><a name="s1"/>Section 1: Basics (Phonology and Writing System)</h2>

<div class="wrap">
<p>
This section will cover the absolute basics of the writing system and phonology, enough to be able to read and have an idea how to pronounce Taisroan. 
</p>

</div>


<h3><a name="s1a"/>Alphabet</h3>
<p>Taisroan has a few various types of scripts, but for the purpose of initially exhibiting its phonetics, it will be displayed in its <em>Standard Alphabet</em>. The alphabet form is, as you would expect, an alphabet. It is written left to right horizontally, with spaces between words, and punctuation usually separating sentences or clauses. Taisroans have other writing systems, such as a syllabic block form, an abjad, and a cusrive varient of this main script. We can get to those later. It is notable, though, that all of the writing systems come with a 1:1 phoneme-grapheme ratio, so spelling shouldn't be too hard. The alphabet is split up into families, which is worth noting.</p>

<p><em>Vowels</em> are the first family, and they come in two variants, sharp ¿¿¿¿¿¿ or Major letters ¿¿¿¿¿ and dull ¿¿¿¿¿ or minor letters ¿¿¿¿¿.</p>

<table width="700">
    <tr id="sharp">
        <td class="tais">á</td>
        <td>/æ/</td>
        <td class="tais">ý</td>
        <td>/aɪ/</td>
        <td class="tais">í</td>
        <td>/i/</td>
        <td class="tais">é</td>
        <td>/e/</td>
        <td class="tais">u</td>
        <td>/ɯ/</td>
    </tr>
        
    <tr id="dull">
        <td class="tais">a</td><td>/a/</td>
        <td class="tais">ẃ</td><td>/ə/</td>
        <td class="tais">i</td><td>/ɪ/</td>
        <td class="tais">e</td><td>/ɛ/</td>
        <td class="tais">o</td><td>/o/</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>Sharp Vowels are respectively close to those in "Hat", "Write", "See", "Pay", and "Food". Though the u is closer to a Japanese u. Dull Vowels are like "Father", "Run", "Hit", "Set", and "Tone".</p>

<div class="wrap">

<table class="left">
    <tr>
        <td class="tais" id="dull"><span class="tais">s</span></td><td id="dull">/s/</td>
        <td class="tais" id="sharp"><span class="tais">z</span></td><td id="sharp">/z/</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="tais" id="dull"><span class="tais">ś</span></td>
        <td id="dull">/ɕ/</td>
        <td class="tais" id="sharp"><span class="tais">ź</span></td>
        <td id="sharp">/ʑ/</td>
    </tr>

        <td class="tais" id="sharp"><span class="tais">j</span></td><td id="sharp">/dʑ/</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Then the first group of consonants is the <em>S Family</em>. This group is is a bit different from the rest of the consonants. They are drawn with voiced sounds sharp. This is an exception, to the norm, but these are normally listed first in the Taisroan letter order. </p>

<p>The first pair sounds like the usual English "s" and "z". The second pair sounds close to "sh" as in "show", and the "s" in "pleasure", and the third pair are similar to "ch" in "choice" and "j" in "join". The sounds are slightly closer to those found in Japanese, however.</p>

      <td class="tais" id="fric"><span class="tais">h</span></td>
      <td id="fric">/h/</td>
      </tr>
</table>
    <p>For the rest of the consonants, there's some consistent patterns where <em>voiced sounds</em> are the dull ones, and are drawn with curves in similar shapes to their angular counterparts, which are <em>unvoiced sounds</em>. The one odd case is the relation between <span class="tais">r</span> and <span class="tais">l</span>, the Taisroan "r" sound is tapped and not really velarized at all, similar, again, to a Japanese r, or the tongue flap when pronouncing "little" fast in American English.</p>

<p>The color coding is how they group the letters, and how it works phonetically. The shades of blue are tongue sounds, the purples are nasals, the oranges approximates, and the last h is on its own because it's lonely and green and that's just not a creative color. These groups will become important later on when discussing how these letters are organized into syllables.</p>
<p>So, lets take a look at the totel phonemic inventory of Taisroan for review. If you're still unsure of how these phonemes are supposed to sound, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_phonetic_alphabet">Wikipedia's page on the IPA</a> can help you.</p>

<p>
Stops are placed with a space before and after. They mark clause separation, similar to a comma.</p>
<p>Fullstops, I-marks and E-marks are placed directly after a word, then a space afterward. These operate quite the same as English punctuation, fullstops, question marks, and exclamation marks respectively.
</p>
<p>Quotes are used for names and quoted dialogue. Punctuation in quoted dialogue goes within quotes. If quotes are used to isolate words, punctuation goes outside the quotes. Stops are not needed for quote braces, as they are built into them.
</p>
<p>Corner Braces may be used for emphasis or vague quoting. Brackets are used for some things, mostly in the numerical system.
</p>
<p>Double stops tend to come before a clarification statement, related clause, or a list, like an English colon or semicolon.

<p>The number system throughout Taisroa has Base-10 numerals, which means just 10 <em>digits.</em> Though later we'll see their culture operates on Base-8 things. Seeing as Taisroans have 10 fingers, counting with 10 had won out as logical over time.</p>
<p><em>Places</em> have specific names as well. As seen in the table on the right, ten, hundred, and thousand have unique names. At ten thousand, the system starts to change. Taisroan groups large numbers into groups of four zeroes. Notice the initial consonants for the names of the numbers on the left table. These also become the initial consonants for the place value of every 4 digits added. For instance,1,0000 is <span class="tais">suq</span>, &quot;suq&quot;; like <span class="tais">sifon</span>, &quot;sifon&quot;. It has <em>1</em> group of four zeroes. So, lets take a number with 4 groups of zeroes; 1,0000,0000,0000,0000 would be <span class="tais">śuq</span>, &quot;śuq&quot;, like <span class="tais">śim</span> &quot;śim&quot;. The Taisroans have not yet needed a number above the <span class="tais">vuq</span> range. For reference, one vuq would be 1,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000. English does not even have a word for this number.</p>
<p>The system also uses a <em>Place-Value System</em>, and numbers are said quite literally. The format goes [number-place, number-place] etc. So, 27 would be said &quot;þaf-dek nem&quot;; 724 would be said &quot;nem-pék þaf-dek śim&quot;. Once you get above the ten-thousand range, you group them in thousands. 63,2413 would be said &quot;kás-dek cén-suq, þaf-źek śim-pék sifon-dek cén.&quot;, Which has a more distinct rhythm than &quot;six hundred thirty two thousand four hundred thirteen&quot;, and just about as many syllables.</p>
<p>The numbers are written in one of two ways. The first is a <em>place-value method</em>, akin to our Arabic numerals. 21,625 would be written<span class="tais"> 2,1625</span>. Taisroan seperates groups of four zeroes with stops like we commonly seperate groups of 3 zeroes with commas. the system is simple enough.</p>
<p>Another system, most commonly used for abreviating longer numbers, is <em>Taisroan Notation.</em> It works by using the digit, and then the initial of the place value corresponding to it. The full value is placed in brackets. For instance, 20 would be [<span class="tais">2d]</span>. 4,0013 would be <span class="tais">[4s,1d,3]</span>. This may seem a bit convoluted, but useful if a number is an estimate or rounded large number, such as 7,0000,0000,0000, or if it has a long gap, such as 41,0000,0013. These can be condenced as <span class="tais">[7c]</span> and <span class="tais">[4d1þ,1d,3]</span> respectively. </p>
<p>With this system, it's also common to mix cases, eliminating some number markers and only designating &quot;suq&quot; groups. For instance, the above number could also be written [<span class="tais">41þ,13]</span>. </p>

<h3><a name="s1d"/>Transliteration</h3>
<div class="wrap">
<p>Since it's impossible to have a font or a writing system everywhere you go, or since it might be hard to learn instantly, there's also ways to transcribe this language with a <em>Transliteration System</em>. In the following table, there are two transliteration systems. One is more accurate and easier to write, the second is made up of substitutions for quick typing, if accents and such aren't available on your keyboard.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the font for taisroan is mapped to the characters that make up the transliteration system. So if one wants to write transliterated, all they would have to do is change the font and it would appear in its proper script. This also may be helpful for viewing this guide, in case some may not be able to see the web fonts.</p>

<h2><a name="s2"/>Section 2: Word Building</h2>
<div class="wrap">
<p>
This section goes over the next step up in competency, syllables and word building. This will cover how exactly taisroan phonetics work in combination. 
</p>
</div>

<h3><a name="s2a"/>Phonetic Rules &amp; Constraints</h3>
<div class="wrap"> 
<p>Word Structure in Taisroan is similar to Japanese. Syllables in general have a CV(N) construction, meaning there is usually a consonant and a vowel, and sometimes a <em>nasal consonant</em> before the next consonant, and sometimes don't have an initial consonant. There is one more rule that is different from Japanese phonetic constraints, and that is the addition of <em>Final Consonants</em>. At the end of a word, but not the end of any syllable, the optional nasal could also be an optional final, which include all of the Sharp Consonants, with the addition of <span class="tais">l</span>. To better organize what I just said, I put it in a table. 
<table width="200" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>(C)</td>
    <td>V</td>
    <td colspan="2">(N)/(F)</td>
    </tr>
  <tr class="tais">
    <td>szśźcjþðfvpbtdkgrlmnqywh</td>
    <td>aeiẃoáéíýu</td>
    <td>mnq</td>
    <td>sścþfptkrl</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Nasals do not come before final consonants, if a word ends in a nasal consonant, it cannot end in a final consonant. Combonations like <span class="tais">ent</span> cannot happen. 
<p>Now that the ground rules are laid down, there are also some <em>exceptions</em>.
<p>First off, Because of the compounding nature of words, it is common for two voiced consonants to be next to each other only if they are the end and beginning of two joined words. A prime example of this exception is the word <span class="tais">taisroa</span>, &quot;taisroa&quot; for &quot;Eight-world&quot;.
<p>Single vowel syllables are not that common and very very rarely come adjacent to each other. Adjacent vowels in general, however, can and do occur.</p>
<p>Another important theme throughout Taisroan is the concept of <em>sized sounds</em> and <em>sound inversion</em>.</p>

    <td>small/minor</td>
  </tr>

    <td>none</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><em>Sized Sounds</em> have to do with open and lower vowels sounding &quot;bigger&quot;, and higher placed vowels sounding &quot;smaller&quot;. Taisroans use much contrast of <span class="tais">i</span> and <span class="tais">a</span> vowels for small and large, minor and major things respectively. It makes sense, too, as one vowel points down, one vowel points up. The three syllables on the right form the basis to many more Taisroan concepts.</p>
<p>To a certain degree, this sometimes lends itself to gender differentiation. Sometimes names add a <span class="tais">i</span> at the end to make it sound more feminine, the same goes for male names and <span class="tais">a</span>.</p>

<p><em>Sound Inversion</em> is another important topic. Often times words that are related may sound similar. Taisroan has a theme of taking some opposites and inverting sounds between them. The table to the left shows some examples of this, as well as applications of sound sizing. </p>
<p>In the words for &quot;rise&quot; and &quot;fall&quot;, the consonants of the first and second syallbles swap, the final consonant and the vowels staying the same. </p>
<p>An additional type occurs between &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;, where the consonants in &quot;goodbye&quot; become their dull counterparts. </p>
<p>There's a few more varieties, and there is no solid consistant pattern, but this just happens to be something that... happens a lot in Taisroan, and may make words easier to memorize.</p>
</div>
<div class="wrap"></div>

<h3><a name="s2b"/>Syllabification</h3>
<div class="wrap">
<p>Syllables are a pretty cool guy, it involves the phonetic details when multiple syllables are put together. Syllabification in Taisroan is not a complex subject as it is very standardized.</p>
<p>There are always audible splits between syllables. Subtle, but present. You could say there is a slight glottal stop at the end of every syllable, or at least a quick reduction in voice. For instance, if the vowels a and í showed up next to each other, they may sound like the single vowel ý, but they would be on opposite sides of a syllable split, and would therefore be pronounced with a cadence that would prevent that confusion. The splits can be seen by dividing words into sections like those laid out above. Keep in mind that suffixes may cause consonant clusters with the final consonant of the root word, so it may be wise to analyze if the last syllable looks like a suffix to clarify its pronunciation.</p>
<p><span class="tais">mikalisvim</span> is a word with a prefix and a suffix. Phonetically, it could be split up as “mi.ka.lis.vim”.</p>
<p><span class="tais">muémáfarzop</span> is another example with both vowel and consonant clusters. With the same technique, it can be split into &quot;mu-é.ma.far-zop&quot;. Again, a bit of knowledge of roots and fixes may be needed, but there aren't too many oddities.</p>
<p>Another quirky rule of syllabification is that if two of the same vowel are next to each other, they are pronounced as one vowel. The word <span class="tais">muualak</span> is merely pronounced &quot;mu.a.lak&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, a big part of language pronounciation are <em>stressed syllables</em>. Taisroan handles syllable accents in an easy way. As in there is<em> one rule</em> and two exceptions. They are as follows.</p>

  <ol>
      <li>The accent is always placed upon the <em>second syllable</em> in a word.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Unless the second syllable is part of a prefix, which then the accent moves to the <em>first non-prefix syllable</em>.</li>
        <li>Unless the word is a title of a person, in which it is placed on the <em>first syllable</em>.</li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
  <p>Title of a person also counts toward names, though names may have variation in cadence. </p>
  <p>Tonality is relatively simple, too. In single words, tone tends to rise as it approaches the stressed syllable and subtly fall after stressed syllables.</p>
</div>
<div class="wrap"></div>

<h2><a name="s3"/>Section 3: Morphology</h2>
<div class="wrap"> 
The morphology of Taisroan is not complex in the slightest. The language has a very "universal" quality to it, and so words aren't often altered very much.
</div>
<div class="wrap"></div>

<h3><a name="s3a"/>Nouns &amp; Pronouns</h3>
<div class="wrap"> 
<p>Nouns in Taisroan have no genders, no tenses, no cases, and no numbers. Pluralization is handled with a suffix that never changes (<span class="tais">lo</span>), tenses with prefixes (<span class="tais">pẃ, me, bo</span>).</p>
<table class="right">
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">kará</td>
    <td>kará</td>
    <td>King/Queen/Lord</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">karí</td>
    <td>karí</td>
    <td>Prince/Princess</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="tais">þap</td>
    <td>þap</td>

    <td class="tais">fé</td>
    <td>fé</td>
    <td>Spouse</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In terms of Gender, Taisroan is almost entirely genderless, even in names for things. There are no words for male and female varieties of things (job titles, animals, kinship terms) and to specify gender, they just use a word or even just a suffix to specify. This serves as a cultural facet of the Taisroan people as well.
</p>
<table class="left">
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">ha</td>
    <td>ha</td>
    <td>Me/I</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">ca</td>
    <td>ca</td>
    <td>You</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">we</td>
    <td>we</td>
    <td>he/she</td>

    <td class="tais">laha</td>
    <td>laha</td>
    <td>We</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">laca</td>
    <td>laca</td>
    <td>You All</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">lawe</td>
    <td>lawe</td>
    <td>They (p)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">wo</td>
    <td>wo</td>
    <td>It</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tais">sẃ</td>
    <td>sẃ</td>
    <td>Self</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As one would expect, Pronouns are genderless as well. That's right, Taisroans get by in everyday life without words for &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;. Taisroans use a singular &quot;they&quot; pronoun. This also functions as a passive pronoun (i.e. &quot;One&quot; in english). For hypotheticals and indirect statements. Taisroan also has a &quot;self&quot; pronoun which is used when referencing the subject as the object as well. &quot;I talk to myself&quot; would be &quot;<span class="tais">ha&nbsp;sẃ&nbsp;gẃl&nbsp;źetím.</span>&quot;</p>
<p>So how does one specify gender when using Taisroa's completely-devoid-of-gender language? Taisroan has words for Male and Female that do not need their own table as they're not that important. They're <span class="tais">þaþ</span>, &quot;þaþ&quot; and <span class="tais">þiþ</span>, &quot;þiþ&quot; respectively.</p>

<h3><a name="s3b"/>Verbs</h3>
<div class="wrap"> 
If you thought that since nouns have only one form that the verbs would too... Well sorry to dissapoint you, you're absolutely right. Verbs in Taisroan only have a root form. There does not have to be any plural or gender agreement, and tenses are covered, again, with particles and fixes. This section should not exist and I'll probably merge it with the nouns and pronouns or get rid of it entirely.

<div class="wrap">
Adjectives and adverbs are normally handled as nouns and have their own special copula (which we'll go over later.) Adjectives and adverbs that are part of a noun phrase or a verb phrase affix themselves to it with special particles.

<p>Get. Fucking. Ready. FOR THE BEAT DOWN.</p>
<p>This language handles most of it's grammar and syntactical shit with prefixes and suffixes. You can basically change the part of speech of any word to any other word with these, give things tense and negation with ease... All of these are fixed. Some modify other different words and are given new connotative meanings because of them. </p>
<p>I seriously don't know how much explanation I can do for this part to fill out the length of this table. It's all pretty straight-forward stuff and things you should understand. Most of the (few) complications would be better fit to be described in other sections. </p>

  <p>Lets start off with particles.</p>
  <p>The first particle, &quot;gẃl&quot;, is a &quot;transitive indicator&quot;. It's placed between the object and the verb to indicate an action is being performed on it. It mostly helps when differenciating between Subject-Verb sentences, and &quot;Subject-Object-Verb&quot; sentances with omitted/implied subjects. For example; &quot;ha źetím&quot; means &quot;I speak&quot;. But &quot;ha gẃl źetím.&quot; means &quot;speak to me&quot; or &quot;tell me&quot;, and omits the object which would most likely be &quot;ca&quot;, &quot;you&quot;.</p>
  <p>&quot;tup&quot; is a catch all word for &quot;having&quot; &quot;bearing&quot; &quot;wearing&quot; etc. It's inserted between an noun and a noun to use what proceeds it as an adjective, or adverb and a verb or adjective, to link the two. Example: &quot;The silver haired child spoke.&quot; would be &quot;sokip tup naśor  di géqso źetím.&quot; It takes &quot;Silver hair&quot; and uses it as an adjective for something to describe the child. You could also think of &quot;tup&quot; as &quot;with&quot;.  </p>
  <p>Copula have two varients in Taisroan. The first, þal, is used for noun = noun. Example: &quot;I am an adult&quot; would be &quot;ha sokap þal.&quot;</p>
  <p>The other, ðil, is used for noun/verb/anything = adjective/adverb. Example: &quot;you are wise&quot; would be &quot;ca íga ðil.&quot;</p>

<p>Taisroan is largely SOV, Subject-Object-Verb. The closest comparison I can make is to Japanese. Lets look at the phrase “this is a rock.”</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p>Taisroan does not have quite as many particles, however. Intransitive verbs work similarly to the copula. Once you get to other transitive verbs, however, we have to use a &quot;transitive indicator&quot; to connect the object of the sentence to the verb being performed. Let's check out &quot;I draw a Circle.&quot;</p>

<p>This would be Taisroan for &quot;It's the silver haired man from kirino.&quot; Order of discriptors is somewhat flexible, but it is common practice to put more specific details closer to the subject. So you would list descriptors of something before you would say where they are from. </p>
<p>So &quot;The guy from kirino with silver hair is speaking to the guy with the red eyes.&quot; Would be fully written out as</p>
<p>&quot;we tup naśor di geqso gan kirino þal we tup qoki di tálẃ gẃl meźetím.&quot;</p>
<p>After this we have prepositions. Fuck that I'll deal with it later.</p>

<h3><a name="s5a"/>Universe</h3>
<!--<div class="wrap">
  <p>Taisroa is literally "Eighth World" and is the "capital planet" of the Eighth universe in the "RaRoa", or "All-Realm."</p>
  <p>The point of the universe is to house spirits, and every star in that universe has at least 4 planets around it that harbor ghosts from every other dead universe. Thankfully, not many planets in other universes have sentient life.</p>
  <p>Taisroa, being the capital planet, is not one of these ghost planets, and has its own unique flora and fauna. The planet is split into two halves, one always dark, and one with a normal day and night cycle. This side of the planet is relatively earth-like...</p>
  <p>The difference is that everything that looks dead is vibrantly alive, and everything that looks alive is probably dead. Leaves and grass are brown and tan, usually. Stones are colors that we'd consider to be flesh color.</p>
  <p>The Taisroan people themselves are humanoid, but their anatomy is somewhat different.</p>
  <p>The average height is smaller. Their skin color ranges from pale gray to dark gray, and tends to look a bit waxy. Their blood looks like molten lead or mercury. Their hair ranges from silvery almost-white to black. Their bones are thinner and denser, as are their muscles, and they don't retain much body fat. Their fingers are longer as well. </p>
  <p>Basically, they look like long decayed, skeletal corpses given life. The place where their life shines through is their eyes, which are always intensely bright hues of color.</p>
  <p>Because of their nearly complete lack of color on their own selves, color is a fascinating subject for the Taisroan People. They describe and classify many things in terms of color, and have traditional spectrums of things that compare emotions, personality traits, sounds, and sensations to colors.</p>
  <p>Though their language is almost completely genderless, Taisroans do have gender dimorphism, but not to a degree like humans. Being less fat-retaining, body shapes tend to be more similar. Since both genders are nearly physically equal, they are by default treated equally as well in society.</p>
  <p>They live in village city-states, usually with stretches of plains beneath each. There aren't many solid bodies of water, but there are many rivers, and rivers above ground tend to lead into below-ground water systems. Taisroans don't really build up, and don't really build out either. There are close family ties and traditions which Taisroans keep to, and extended family members tend to keep within their family's craft and live together in their house/shop. </p>
  <p>The biggest city in Taisroa is that which lies on the wall that separates two sides of the planet. It has an enormous palace-castle which has many mystical operations going on within its walls.</p>

<h2><a name="s5a"/>Time</h2>
<div class="wrap">
<p>On Taisroa, time passes a bit differently. They also do not have a moon, but instead a giant constructed crystaline satelite that they measure like one. It was placed in a way so that months are always standard. As far as division goes from there, There are a few different systems, but what became mostly standard was the Kirino System, which was meant to be standard with the Earthen "hour" and "day".
